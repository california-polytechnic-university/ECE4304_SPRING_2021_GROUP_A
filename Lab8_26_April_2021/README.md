Submitted by Group A - Yuta Akiya, Kyle Le, Megan Luong

## Description
* The letters "DMH" are displayed onto the top left of the display connected via VGA. 
* The colors of the letters are controlled by 12 switches: 4 red, 4 green, and 4  blue.
* The position of the letters are controlled via UART by sending an 8-bit value. The first 4 bits control the Y position of the letters whilst the last 4 bits control the X position of the letters.
