# Lab 4 - 7-Segment Display Counter
Submitted by Group A - Yuta Akiya, Kyle Le, Megan Luong

## Description
Using the 7-segment display on the FPGA, a value will be displayed. This value will either increment or decrement depending on a switch. Also, the speed at which this value changes will also be controlled by switches.

A separate reset for the value and the displays are set up.
