# Final Project - SHA-3 System with UART/VGA/7-Segment Display using MicroBlaze
Submitted by Group A - Yuta Akiya, Kyle Le, Megan Luong

## Description
This final report includes everything learned in the class to create a system that implements Secure Hash Algorithm 3 (SHA-3). This involves the UART, VGA, and 7-segment display systems. In addition, the MicroBlaze microprocessor was configured and added to add a C++ overhead.

1. VGA
   * Output value of hash generated by SHA-3 component
   * Able to display different hash lengths - 224, 256, 384, 512
   * Hash length displayed is controlled by input switches
3. 7-Segment Display
   * Displays what mode the SHA-3 component is currently using - 224, 256, 384, 512
   * Value change is controlled by input switches
5. SHA-3
   * Accepts 1144-bit message and returns the SHA-3 hash depending on the mode
   * Mode is controlled by input switches - 224, 256, 384, 512
   * Incorporates Keccak Permutation in one clock cycle
   * SHA-3 implementation done through a state machine
7. MicroBlaze System with UART
   * System is packaged into a custom IP to be integrated with MicroBlaze
   * Connection from MicroBlaze to custom IP using AXI
   * C++ overhead to allow UART read/write to SHA-3 IP
