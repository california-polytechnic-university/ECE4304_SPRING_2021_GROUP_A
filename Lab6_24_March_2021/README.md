# Lab 6 - Barrel Rotator
Submitted by Group A - Yuta Akiya, Kyle Le, Megan Luong

## Description
A generic barrel shifter is programmed to be able to rotate 0-(WIDTH-1) times. This is combined with the 7-segment components from previous labs to display onto the FPGA. 

The FPGA implementation will implement the barrel shifter as 8-bits. The 8-bit inputs will come from 8 FPGA switches. The amount of bits shifted will be represented by 3 different switches on the FPGA. 

The 7-segment display will display the BCD decimal value of the input, shift amount, and value after the shift.
