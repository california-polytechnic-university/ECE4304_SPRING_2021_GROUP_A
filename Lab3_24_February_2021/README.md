# Lab 3 - BCD to Binary Converter Displayed onto 7-Segment Displays
Submitted by Group A - Yuta Akiya, Kyle Le, Megan Luong

## Description
A BCD Converter takes in a set of four input switches and produces BCD values (0-9). The output value is then put through a 7-segment decoder to obtain values to be displayed. Using multiplexing and a clock divider, two of these BCD to 7-segment systems are used to display two separate values onto the 7-segment displays on the FPGA board.
