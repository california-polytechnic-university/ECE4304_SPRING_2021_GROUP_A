# Lab 1 - Generic Nx1 Mux
Submitted by Group A - Yuta Akiya, Kyle Le, Megan Luong

## Description
 A generic Nx1 mux is made using a network of 2x1 muxes and for loops. This is then tested as a 64x1 mux in the testbench and 16x1 in hardware demo on the Nexys A7 100T FPGA board.
 For the simulation, the testbench included the use of the textio library for importing a stream of inputs to the simulation and storing the output into a separate text file.
